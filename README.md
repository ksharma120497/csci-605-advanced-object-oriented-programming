# csci-605-advanced-object-oriented-programming

This course focuses on identifying advanced object-oriented programming concepts and implementing them in the context of specific problems. 
This course covers advanced concepts such as event-driven programming, design patterns, distributed and concurrent programming, and the use, design and implementation of applications. 
Assignments (both in class and as homework) requiring a solution to a problem and an implementation in code are an integral part of the course. 

## Topics covered
- Basic Algorithms (BFS, DFS)
- Data structures and Collections
- Conditional statements and Loops
- Encapsulatio, Inheritance, Abstraction and Polymorphism
- Interfaces and Abstract classes
- Multi threading
- Socket Network Interface
